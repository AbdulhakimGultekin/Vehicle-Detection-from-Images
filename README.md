# Vehicle-Detection-from-Images
There are 10 images seperated to two groups ("te" stands for test and "tr" is for training) and each group classified as easy, medium and 
hard. These images are related to "main.m" MATLAB file which has been developed to detect vehicles from the images. Remember that every 
image has its own specifications to handle detection process and so this code will not be appropriate for all given images. The aim here is 
to show a basic way on how to develop a program to detect objects from an image.
